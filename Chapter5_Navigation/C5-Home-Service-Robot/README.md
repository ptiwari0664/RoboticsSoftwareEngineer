# RoboND-Term1-P5-Home-Service-Robot
Project 5 of Udacity Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree
![Overview](https://github.com/anyuguo/Robotics-Software-Engineer-Udacity/blob/master/P5-Home-Service-Robot/video.gif)  

## Overview  
In this project, you will use everything you learned in the Nanodegree Program to build a Home Service Robot in ROS.  
### Mapping  
You will create a `test_slam.sh` script file and launch it to manually test SLAM.  
A functional map of the environment should be created which would be used for localization and navigation tasks.  
### Localization and Navigation  
You will create a `test_navigation.sh` script file to launch it for manual navigation test.  
Your robot should be able to navigate in the environment after a 2D Nav Goal command is issued.  
You will create a `pick_objects.sh` file that will send multiple goals for the robot to reach.  
The robot travels to the desired pickup zone, displays a message that it reached its destination, waits 5 seconds, travels to the desired drop off zone, and displays a message that it reached the drop off zone."  
### Home Service Functions  
You will create a `add_marker.sh` file that will publish a marker to rviz.  
The marker should initially be published at the pickup zone. After 5 seconds it should be hidden. Then after another 5 seconds it should appear at the drop off zone.
The student should write a home_service.sh file that will run all the nodes in this project.  
The student's home service robot should be simulated as follow:  
* Initially show the marker at the pickup zone.
* Hide the marker once your robot reach the pickup zone.
* Wait 5 seconds to simulate a pickup.
* Show the marker at the drop off zone once your robot reaches it.

## Run the project  
* Clone this repository
```

```
* Navigate to the `src` folder and clone the necessary repositories  
```
cd RoboND-Term1-P5-Home-Service-Robot/catkin_ws/src  
git clone https://github.com/ros-perception/slam_gmapping.git  
git clone https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot.git  
git clone https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot_interactions.git  
git clone https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot_simulator.git  
```
* Open the repository, make and source  
```
cd /home/workspace/catkin_ws/
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```
* Launch the home service robot
```
./src/scripts/home_service.sh
```
* Done. 

## Tips  
1. It's recommended to update and upgrade your environment before running the code.  
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```
2. If your system python version from miniconda is python3 while the ros packages and tf are python2. A hack is to just set the system python to python2 via symbol link. Run the following commands to resolve it  
```
ln -s /usr/bin/python2 /root/miniconda3/bin/python
```
3. How to setup your environment at start up.  
```
Add the following line into the /home/workspace/.student_bashrc
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages  
pip install catkin_pkg  
pip install rospkg  
```
4. How create package with dependencies  
```
catkin_create_pkg pick_objects move_base_msgs actionlib roscpp  
catkin_create_pkg add_markers roscpp visualization_msgs  
```
5. How to visualize your marker in the rviz  
To see the marker(virtual objects) demo, in addition to running the `./add_marker.sh`, you will need to manually add a 'Marker' in rviz with the following steps:  
* Find your rviz window  
* In the left bottom panel, click "Add" button  
* In 'By display type' tab, navigate the tree to 'rviz' then 'Marker'  
* Click 'OK' button  
* Done, you should see the marker(virtual objects) appear, disappear then appear again  

## Code Style  
Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
